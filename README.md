# Personal website - Pierre Luc Nichols

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [React App Rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) to allow some customization without ejecting out of CRA.  I'm also using the following tools: [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router), [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/), [Polished](https://polished.js.org/) and [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier).

## Get started
Here's some information on how to perform common tasks:
- [npm start](#npm-start) *(start dev environment with live reloading)*
- [npm test](#npm-test) *(run jest test suite)*
- [npm run build](#npm-run-build) *(build the app for production in `build` folder)*
- [npm run deploy](#npm-run-deploy) *(deploy to github pages)*

You can find the most recent version of the Create React App guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app and deploys to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and pushes all the changes to the `master` branch.
